### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Research Scientist at Fano Labs working on automatic speech recognition (ASR). Previously, I was a PhD student in Modern Statistics and Statistical Machine Learning at Imperial College London.

I am interested in Generative modelling, score-based methods, probabilistic modelling and approximate inference for high-dimensional data, such as climate data, images and videos.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to write good code.
