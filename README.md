### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a 4th-year PhD student in Modern Statistics and Statistical Machine Learning at Imperial College London.

I'm interested in Generative modelling, score-based methods, probabilistic modelling and approximate inference for high-dimensional data, such as climate data, images and videos.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to write good code.
